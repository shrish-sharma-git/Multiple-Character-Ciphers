# Multiple Character Ciphers

This project was built as the final project of Open-Source Software Lab (OSSL) - 5th Semester.

We have built a web-based tool which provides the user with four of the 
popular character cipher encryption/decryption techniques options to choose 
from and to encrypt/decrypt his/her data.
The four encryption/decryption techniques are as follows:
1. Caesar Cipher
2. Rail fence Cipher
3. Playfair Cipher
4. Vigenere Cipher
